        <h3>Ma'ono Fried Chicken & Whiskey</h3>
        <p>I went to dinner here with friends on my birthday last year. Their Hawaiian fried chicken is unique, high quality, and not at all pretentious. If you're ever looking for a great meal in Seattle, I recommend it.</p>

        <h3>Tedeschi Trucks Band Made Up Mind</h3>
        <p>The latest album from one of my favorite bands. Their modern blues features some tremendous vocal and instrumental talent. They also put on great live shows (though I was unable to catch them in 2013).</p>

        <h3>A Death in Brazil by Peter Robb</h3>
        <p>this is probably the coolest history book I've ever read. Covers both the early colonial history and more recent political drama and reads like a novel. Fascinating stuff.</p>

        <h3>Sulphur Mountain Cosmic Ray Station</h3>
        <p>Sulphur Mountain Cosmic Ray Station in Banff, Canada. My friends and I hiked to the top and took a bunch of great photos. Scenery shots are pretty easy when you can find a great view like the top of a mountain but I like this one because it's not simply looking straight down.</p>

        <h3>David Simon: Trayvon</h3>
        <p>David Simon's blog is full of great writing about a lot of different topics but I particularly enjoyed this piece. It's brief but still fully encompasses my frustration with the death of Trayvon and the acquittal of his murderer. </p>
